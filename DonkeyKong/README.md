Description:
Donkey Kong is an arcade platform videogame created by Nintendo in 1981. 
It is about a protagonist character, Mario (first called Jumpan), who has 
to rescue a lady in distress called Pauline (originally named Lady) who 
has been kidnapped by an enormous gorilla called Donkey Kong. The player 
goes through different scenarios and has to dodge attacks Donkey Kong throws 
against him in order to rescue Pauline. This game is one of the most important 
and popular games of the Arcade Golden Age.


How to play:
Level 2: Get to the top without dying
Level 3: Get to the top without dying
Level 4: Destroy the beams in order to make Donkey Kong fall and get to Pauline!

Don't let the enemies get you, make sure to use the hammer.
