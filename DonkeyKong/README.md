It is about a protagonist character, Mario (first called Jumpan), who has

has been kidnapped by an enormous gorilla called Donkey Kong. The player 
goes through different scenarios and has to dodge attacks Donkey Kong throws 
against him in order to rescue Pauline. This game is one of the most important 
and popular games of the Arcade Golden Age.
