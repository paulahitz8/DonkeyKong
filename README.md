**1. GAME DESCRIPTION**<br/><br/>
Donkey Kong is an arcade platform video game created by Nintendo in 1981. It is about a protagonist character, Mario (or Jumpman as it was called back then), who has to rescue a lady (Pauline) that has been kidnapped by an enormous gorilla named Donkey Kong. The player goes through different scenarios and has to dodge whatever attacks Donkey Kong throws against him in order to rescue Pauline.Donkey Kong is one of the most important games from the golden age of arcade video games as well as one of the most popular and greatest arcade games of all time<br/><br/>

**2. GENERAL ANALYSIS**<br/><br/>
**1. Genre, similar games, market positioning.**<br/>
Donkey Kong is a platform game in which the player controls a character named Mario. There are many similar games (it has been said that it was the first platform game ever, which means that it inspired every platform game made from then on), like Don Doko Don (1989) or  Aldo’s Adventure (1987), which was heavily inspired on Donkey Kong. 
Donkey Kong succeeded commercially in Japan, but, most of all, it became extremely popular in the United States and Canada. The game's initial 2,000 units sold, and more orders were made. Arakawa began manufacturing the electronic components in Redmond because waiting for shipments from Japan was taking too long.  By October, Donkey Kong was selling 4,000 units a month, and by late June 1982, Nintendo had sold 60,000 Donkey Kong machines overall and earned $180 million.<br/>
**2. Technical profile: hardware used (gpu, memory), original resolution, fps, etc.**<br/>
About technical specifications, the game uses a Z80 @3.072 MHz CPU, and is displayed in a Raster monitor (vertical, 224 x 256 resolution, 256 out of 768 colors). The hardware has the memory capacity for displaying 128 foreground sprites at 16x16 pixels each and 256 background tiles at 8x8 pixels each. Mario and all moving objects use single sprites, the taller Pauline uses two sprites, and the larger Donkey Kong uses six sprites.The character set, scoreboard, upper HUD display, and font are almost identical to Radar Scope, with palette differences.<br/>
**3. History of the game: Original creators, date of release, hardware, history of versions, etc.**<br/>
Nintendo had been trying to get popular in America, but all efforts hadn’t come to anything, like Space Radar, a game that left Nintendo with many copies unsold.
To to do something with them, the company's president, Hiroshi Yamauchi, thought of turning them into something new, keeping the same hardware and software. They wanted to “reuse” all of them for another game. He put Shigeru Miyamoto to it and appointed Nintendo chief engineer Gunpei Yokoi to oversee the project. Nintendo's game development budget was $ 100,000.
At the time, Nintendo was trying to get licence for Popeye, but failed. They took the opportunity to create new characters that could then be marketed and used in later games. Miyamoto came up with a love triangle between a gorilla, a carpenter, and a girl that was similar to the romantic plot from Popeye . Miyamoto decided that one of the characters would be an ape, which he said was "nothing too evil or repulsive", and said ape would be the pet of the main character, "a funny, hang-loose kind of guy”.
The circuit board of Radar Scope was restructured for Donkey Kong. The Radar Scope hardware had functions Donkey Kong did not require, se they were removed and reduced the scale of the circuit board.While the gameplay and graphics were reworked for updated ROM chips, the existing CPU, sound hardware and monitor were left intact.
The game officially went on sale in July 1981.
Makers of video game consoles became interested when the success became clear. Taito offered a considerable sum to buy all rights to Donkey Kong, but Nintendo turned them down. With the popularity that Donkey Kong acquired, many companies began to want to make versions for their own consoles.
For example, Coleco did made a version to ColecoVision console. Six months later, Coleco offered Atari 2600 and Intellivision versions as well. Coleco's sales doubled to $500 million and its earnings quadrupled to $40 million. Coleco's console versions of Donkey Kong sold six million cartridges in total, grossing over $153 million, and earning Nintendo more than $5 million in royalties. Coleco also released stand-alone Mini-Arcade tabletop versions of Donkey Kong, which, along with Pac.Man, Galaxian and Frogger sold three million units combined. Meanwhile, Atari got the license for computer versions of Donkey Kong and released it for the Atari 400 and 800. Miyamoto created a greatly simplified version for the Game & Watch multiscreen handheld device. Other ports include the Apple II, Atari 7800, Intellivision, Commodore VIC-20, Famicom Disk System, IBM PC booter, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX, Atari 8-bit family and Mini-Arcade versions.<br/><br/><br/>
